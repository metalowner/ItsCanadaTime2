[Preview](https://itscanadatime.github.io/Landing-Page-Three)


## Set up your workspace

First of all download or clone the repository to the folder of your choice.

In order to read and edit the code with ease I recommed using Sublime Text editor or any other edit you are familiar with.

Download and install Sublime Text from [here](https://www.sublimetext.com/3).


## Registering

### Domains cost money

The first step is buying a domain that is related to immigration to Canada.

Here is a trusted [domain listing service](http://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8408662-12892698) but you can use whatever service you want for this step.


## The HTML

Everything you see on the web is HTML.

Open index.html

Here you will find the page **content** which includes all the displayed elements.

Each HTML element is defined with < Element Name> **Content** </Element Name>

The comments are presented as gray text that explain each element and how to edit it.

Important note: Edit only the elements that have the EDIT THIS AREA note.

In general with the exception of the <meta> elements when editing the page elements edit **only** the content field.


## The CSS

CSS is in charge of how the HTML will be displayed.

Go to template folder and open style.css

As you can see CSS looks different than HTML and has a different task.

While HTML is the page content the CSS is the page **style** which defines how the HTML content elements will look and behave when interacted.

CSS has different style attributes that define which changes to make in the default HTML element.

Each CSS command starts with a call to an excisting HTML element such as: **.content** and has certain attributes changed within the curvy braces { **style attributes** }

Same as the HTML the CSS file also has comments which explain each part and how to edit it.

## Hosting

### Hosting services cost money

The next step is uploading your landing page to the web and making it public!

Here is the guide from best hosting service around (For now) [Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/GetStartedWithS3.html).

Last but not least is connecting your hosting to the domain you baught and publishing your landing page!
Here is [Amazons' guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/website-hosting-custom-domain-walkthrough.html) on how to do it.

Good Luck!
